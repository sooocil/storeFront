## Key Features

### For Shoppers (Public Site)

  - **Storefront (`/`)**: Browse products in a clean grid layout.
  - **Products List (`/products`)**: Find exactly what you're looking for with search, filters, and pagination.
  - **Product Details (`/product/[id]`)**: See full product info and add items to your cart.
  - **Shopping Cart**: A slick floating cart button lets you view your items and head to a mock checkout.

### For Admins (Back Office)

  - **Secure Login & Signup**: Mock authentication using a token stored in your browser's local storage.
  - **Dashboard**: Manage products and users with dedicated pages for each.
  - **CRUD Operations**: Add and remove products (all changes are mocked and stay local to your browser).

## Non-Functional Goodies

Beyond the main features, I focused on creating a great user and developer experience:

  - **Modular Code**: Clean, well-organized, and typed components for easy maintenance.
  - **No Prop Drilling**: State is managed efficiently using Zustand stores.
  - **Error Handling**: Data fetching errors are handled gracefully.
  - **Sleek UI/UX**: Enjoy fast loading with skeleton loaders.
